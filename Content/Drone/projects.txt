(Upcoming Projects)

UDN- Optimus prime

About: Optimus is a highly advanced UAV that is specially engineered to capture other drones in mid air, neutralising potential threats with its precision and efficiency. This will be equipped with more sensors than a normal quad.this can be used when other drones are flying in restricted area.many autonomous features and specifications will be announced soon.

UDN-Helicarrier

About: Helicarrier will be engineered to tackle demanding logistics challenges. It will be able to lift and transport heavy loads with a very high accuracy. Not only the weight but it will be able to clutch any object with an irregular shape. Despite the load it will be remarkable for flying with stability and strength.the lifting process is completely done only by  Helicarrier no human interference will be noticed.


UDN-VTOL
